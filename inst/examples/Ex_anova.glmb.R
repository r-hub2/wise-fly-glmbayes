# anova for Bayesian Model
# Sequential classical ANOVA (see glm anova below): adding outcome reduces residual deviance;
# adding treatment barely changes it.
# By DIC, the model with outcome but not treatment has the lowest DIC;
# treatment does not improve the criterion.
# Use of traditional anova is questionable in a Bayesian context.
# One may instead use Bayes factors or other approaches.
