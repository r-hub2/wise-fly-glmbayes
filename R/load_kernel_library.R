#' Load OpenCL Kernel Source Files
#'
#' These functions provide a user-facing interface for loading OpenCL kernel
#' source files and kernel libraries from the package's `cl/` directory.
#' They call internal C++ routines that perform file lookup, dependency
#' resolution, and concatenation of kernel sources.
#'
#' OpenCL support is optional. If the package was built without OpenCL
#' (e.g., on systems lacking OpenCL headers or drivers), these functions
#' return a clear error message.
#'
#' @section OpenCL Availability:
#' Use \code{\link{has_opencl}} to check whether OpenCL support is available
#' in the current build of \pkg{glmbayes}.
#'
#'
#' @section How These Functions Assemble an OpenCL Program:
#'
#' The functions \code{load_kernel_source()} and \code{load_kernel_library()}
#' are the fundamental tools used by \pkg{glmbayes} to construct complete
#' OpenCL programs from modular components. OpenCL kernels in this package are
#' not stored as monolithic `.cl` files. Instead, they are built dynamically
#' by concatenating several layers of source code, each serving a distinct
#' purpose in the final GPU program.
#'
#' A typical OpenCL program used by \pkg{glmbayes} is assembled in the
#' following order:
#'
#' \enumerate{
#'
#'   \item \strong{Global configuration header}  
#'     The file \code{OPENCL.cl} defines global extensions, IEEE constants,
#'     helper macros, and device-side utilities. It plays a role analogous to
#'     a C/C++ header file and must appear at the very top of every combined
#'     kernel module.  
#'     It enables features such as double-precision arithmetic
#'     (\code{cl_khr_fp64}) and device-side debugging (\code{cl_khr_printf}).
#'
#'   \item \strong{Mathematical library modules}  
#'     Subdirectories such as \code{"rmath"}, \code{"dpq"}, and \code{"nmath"}
#'     contain collections of `.cl` files implementing mathematical functions
#'     used throughout the GLM likelihood and gradient computations.  
#'
#'     Each file may declare \code{@provides} and \code{@depends} tags.
#'     \code{load_kernel_library()} reads all files in a subdirectory,
#'     parses these annotations, performs a dependency-aware topological sort,
#'     and concatenates the files in an order that guarantees that upstream
#'     functions appear before downstream callers.  
#'
#'     This mechanism is conceptually similar to a sequence of
#'     \code{#include} statements in C/C++, but with automatic dependency
#'     resolution.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Model-specific helper functions}  
#'     Some kernels require additional device-side utilities that are not part
#'     of the shared libraries. These are typically loaded using
#'     \code{load_kernel_source()} and appended after the library modules.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Final kernel entry function}  
#'     The last component is the model-specific kernel that OpenCL will
#'     execute on the device. For example, in the function
#'     \code{f2_f3_opencl()}, the final kernel is selected based on the GLM
#'     family and link function (e.g., \code{"f2_f3_binomial_logit"}).  
#'
#'     This kernel must appear last in the combined program, after all helper
#'     functions and libraries have been defined, because OpenCL requires that
#'     all functions be defined before they are referenced.
#'
#' }
#'
#' The resulting program is a single, syntactically valid OpenCL source string
#' that is passed directly to the OpenCL compiler (e.g., via
#' \code{clBuildProgram}). The ordering performed by
#' \code{load_kernel_library()} is essential for successful compilation and
#' ensures that the GPU kernels used by \pkg{glmbayes} are reproducible,
#' modular, and maintainable.
#'
#' The function \code{f2_f3_opencl()} provides a concrete example of this
#' assembly process: it loads the global configuration header, then the
#' mathematical libraries, then the model-specific kernel file, and finally
#' concatenates these components into a complete OpenCL program that is sent
#' to the GPU for evaluation of the log-likelihood and gradient.
#'
#' @section Preparing a Global Configuration Header:
#'
#' Most OpenCL programs begin with a small configuration header that enables
#' device extensions, defines IEEE constants, and provides utility macros used
#' throughout the kernel code.  The file \code{OPENCL.cl} included in the
#' examples illustrates one such header, but users are free to design their own.
#'
#' A configuration header typically includes:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{Extension declarations} such as
#'     \code{#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp64 : enable} to activate
#'     double-precision arithmetic.
#'
#'   \item \strong{IEEE constants} (e.g., \code{ML_NAN}, \code{ML_POSINF}),
#'     which many statistical kernels rely on.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Utility macros} such as \code{INLINE} or \code{R_UNUSED}
#'     to improve readability and suppress warnings.
#'
#'   \item \strong{Optional helper definitions} such as work-item macros,
#'     typedefs, or device-side debugging tools.
#' }
#'
#' This header should appear at the very top of every combined OpenCL program.
#' The function \code{load_kernel_source()} is typically used to load it.
#' 
#' @section Library-Level Header Files:
#'
#' In addition to individual \code{.cl} files that define functions, most
#' OpenCL libraries also require a \emph{library-level header file}. This file
#' contains constants, macros, error-handling definitions, and other shared
#' utilities that apply to the entire library. It is conceptually similar to a
#' C/C++ header such as \code{<math.h>} or \code{Rmath.h}.
#'
#' A library-level header file:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item defines numerical constants (e.g., \code{ML_NAN}, \code{ML_POSINF}),
#'   \item provides OpenCL-safe versions of R's mathlib macros,
#'   \item stubs out error and warning hooks for device-side execution,
#'   \item defines validation macros such as \code{ISNAN} and \code{R_FINITE},
#'   \item declares error codes and error-handling helpers, and
#'   \item provides any library-wide constants (e.g., \code{WILCOX_MAX}).
#' }
#'
#' This file is typically named after the library itself (e.g.,
#' \code{"nmath.cl"}) and is placed in the same directory as the other
#' library files. It should be loaded \emph{before} any of the function-level
#' files in the library, because those files may rely on macros or constants
#' defined here.
#'
#' A simplified example of such a header is shown below:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'   // nmath.cl - OpenCL math constants, macros & remaps for GPU kernels
#'
#'   // Stub out R's error/warning hooks for OpenCL
#'   #ifndef MATHLIB_ERROR
#'     #define MATHLIB_ERROR(fmt, ...) /* no-op */
#'   #endif
#'
#'   // Numerical constants
#'   #define ML_POSINF (1.0 / 0.0)
#'   #define ML_NEGINF (-1.0 / 0.0)
#'   #define ML_NAN    (0.0 / 0.0)
#'
#'   // Error codes
#'   #define ME_DOMAIN    1
#'   #define ME_RANGE     2
#'   #define ME_NOCONV    4
#'   #define ME_PRECISION 8
#'
#'   // Validation macros
#'   #define ISNAN(x)    (isnan(x))
#'   #define R_FINITE(x) (isfinite(x))
#'
#'   // Error-handling macros
#'   #define ML_ERR_return_NAN \
#'       do { ML_ERROR(ME_DOMAIN, fname); return ML_NAN; } while(0)
#'
#'   // Library-wide constants
#'   #define WILCOX_MAX 50
#' }
#'
#' When \code{load_kernel_library()} processes a library directory, it first
#' loads this header file (if present) and then loads the remaining files in
#' dependency-correct order. This ensures that all macros and constants are
#' available before any function-level code is compiled.
#'
#' Library-level headers are optional but strongly recommended. They provide a
#' clean, centralized place to define constants and macros that would otherwise
#' need to be duplicated across multiple files. This structure is general and
#' applies to any OpenCL project, not only to statistical or mathematical
#' libraries.
#'
#' @section Preparing Library Files:
#'
#' A library file is a single \code{.cl} source file containing one or more
#' device-side functions. To allow \code{load_kernel_library()} to assemble
#' these files in a dependency-correct order, each file should begin with a
#' small annotation block describing what the file provides and what it
#' depends on.
#'
#' A typical library file begins with three comment lines:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'   // @provides: symbol1, symbol2, ...
#'   // @depends:  fileA, fileB, ...
#'   // @includes: library_name
#' }
#'
#' \describe{
#'
#'   \item{\code{@provides}}{
#'     A comma-separated list of function names defined in this file.
#'     These names are used by the dependency resolver to determine which
#'     files satisfy which requirements.
#'   }
#'
#'   \item{\code{@depends}}{
#'     A comma-separated list of \emph{file names} (excluding the \code{.cl}
#'     extension) that this file depends on. Only \emph{direct} dependencies
#'     should be listed. For example, if functions in file A call functions in
#'     file B, and functions in file B call functions in file C, then file A
#'     should list only \code{B} in its \code{@depends} tag—not \code{C}.
#'     Every file in a library must list the library’s header file (the file
#'     whose name matches the library directory) in its \code{@depends} tag,
#'     along with any additional files it directly relies on. This ensures that
#'     the header is always loaded first and that all dependencies are resolved
#'     in the correct order.
#'   }
#'
#'   \item{\code{@includes}}{
#'     The name of the library to which this file belongs (e.g.,
#'     \code{"nmath"}). This tag does \emph{not} affect dependency ordering.
#'     Instead, it serves as metadata that groups related files into a
#'     coherent library. The \code{load_kernel_library()} function uses this
#'     information for diagnostics and consistency checks.
#'   }
#'
#' }
#'
#' The following example illustrates the recommended format:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'   // expm1.cl - OpenCL adaptation of expm1.c
#'   // @provides: expm1
#'   // @depends:  nmath, log1p
#'   // @includes: nmath
#'
#'   #ifndef HAVE_EXPM1
#'   double expm1(double x) {
#'       ...
#'   }
#'   #endif
#' }
#'
#' The dependency resolver in \code{load_kernel_library()} reads the
#' \code{@provides} and \code{@depends} tags, constructs a directed graph of
#' file dependencies, and performs a topological sort to ensure that:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item all required files are loaded before they are referenced,
#'   \item files with no dependencies (typically the library header) are
#'         loaded first,
#'   \item files depending on others are loaded later, and
#'   \item circular or missing dependencies are detected and reported.
#' }
#'
#' The \code{@includes} tag is not used for dependency resolution; it simply
#' identifies the library grouping to which the file belongs.
#'
#' This annotation format is general and applies to any OpenCL project. It
#' allows users to port existing C/C++ mathematical libraries into OpenCL
#' simply by translating the functions into \code{.cl} files and adding the
#' appropriate \code{@provides} and \code{@depends} tags.
#'
#' @section Dependency Resolution, Circular Logic, and Verbose Output:
#'
#' The \code{load_kernel_library()} function performs a dependency-aware
#' topological sort of all \code{.cl} files in the specified library
#' directory. Each file is promoted into the sorted load order only when all
#' of the file names listed in its \code{@depends} tag have already been
#' promoted. Files with an empty \code{@depends} list (typically the library
#' header file) are promoted first.
#'
#' If, during the sorting process, no additional files can be promoted, the
#' function concludes that the remaining files have either:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item circular dependencies (e.g., file A depends on file B, and file B
#'         depends on file A), or
#'   \item missing dependencies (e.g., a file lists a dependency that does not
#'         correspond to any \code{.cl} file in the directory).
#' }
#'
#' In such cases, the function throws a runtime error:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'   "Dependency sort failed: unresolved dependencies remain."
#' }
#'
#' This error prevents the construction of an invalid or incomplete OpenCL
#' program.
#'
#' When \code{verbose = TRUE}, \code{load_kernel_library()} prints detailed
#' diagnostic information describing each stage of the dependency-resolution
#' process. The verbose output includes:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item the list of all \code{.cl} files discovered in the library,
#'   \item the initial set of files with no dependencies,
#'   \item the set of unsorted files and their dependency counts,
#'   \item each pass of the while-loop used for topological sorting,
#'   \item for each file, whether each dependency has already been satisfied,
#'   \item which files are promoted on each pass, and
#'   \item a final summary of the sorted load order.
#' }
#'
#' If circular or missing dependencies are detected while \code{verbose = TRUE},
#' the function prints the list of files that could not be promoted before
#' raising the error. This makes it straightforward for users to identify
#' incorrect or incomplete \code{@depends} tags. In rare cases, files may need
#' to be split or functions rewritten to eliminate genuine circular
#' dependencies.
#'  
#' @section Writing Kernel Files:
#'
#' After preparing a configuration header and any required libraries, users
#' typically write one or more OpenCL \emph{kernel} files.  A kernel is the
#' entry point executed on the device and is usually designed for tasks that
#' are embarrassingly parallel.
#'
#' A kernel file should:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item begin with any required \code{#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION} lines,
#'   \item include any constants or local macros needed by the computation,
#'   \item define a \code{__kernel void} function that operates on global
#'         buffers, and
#'   \item avoid dependencies on host-side libraries (OpenCL C is a restricted
#'         subset of C99).
#' }
#'
#' The example below illustrates a kernel that computes a quadratic form and
#' gradient for each grid point in parallel.  It demonstrates typical OpenCL
#' idioms such as:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item using \code{get_global_id(0)} to index work-items,
#'   \item reading from \code{__global} buffers,
#'   \item accumulating results in local arrays, and
#'   \item writing results back to global memory.
#' }
#'
#' Kernel files are usually loaded with \code{load_kernel_source()} and placed
#' at the end of the assembled program so that all helper functions and library
#' routines are defined before the kernel is compiled. 
#' @section Kernel Runners and Kernel Wrappers:
#'
#' Although not strictly required, it is strongly recommended to separate
#' OpenCL execution into two layers: a \emph{kernel runner} and a
#' \emph{kernel wrapper}. This is the design used throughout the
#' \pkg{glmbayes} implementation and provides a clean, modular structure for
#' preparing inputs, launching OpenCL kernels, and post‑processing results.
#'
#' \subsection{Kernel Runners}{
#' A kernel runner is a low‑level C++ function that interacts directly with
#' the OpenCL runtime. It is responsible for:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item selecting the OpenCL platform and device,
#'   \item creating the context and command queue,
#'   \item compiling the combined program source,
#'   \item creating device buffers and transferring data,
#'   \item setting kernel arguments,
#'   \item launching the kernel via \code{clEnqueueNDRangeKernel()},
#'   \item reading results back to host memory, and
#'   \item releasing all OpenCL resources.
#' }
#'
#' Kernel runners contain \emph{no R‑specific logic}. They operate entirely on
#' flattened numeric arrays and primitive types. This makes them reusable
#' across many kernels and easy to test in isolation.
#'
#' In \pkg{glmbayes}, the function \code{f2_f3_kernel_runner()} is the primary
#' example of a kernel runner. It takes fully prepared inputs, executes the
#' OpenCL kernel, and returns raw numeric outputs.
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Kernel Wrappers}{
#' A kernel wrapper is an R‑facing function (typically exported via
#' \code{[[Rcpp::export]]}) that prepares inputs for the runner and performs
#' any necessary post‑processing. A wrapper is responsible for:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item validating R inputs and extracting dimensions,
#'   \item flattening matrices and vectors into contiguous arrays,
#'   \item selecting the appropriate kernel name and kernel file based on
#'         model family and link function,
#'   \item assembling the full OpenCL program source by concatenating the
#'         core OpenCL header, library sources, and the model‑specific kernel,
#'   \item invoking the kernel runner with the prepared inputs, and
#'   \item reshaping or converting the runner’s outputs into R‑friendly
#'         structures (e.g., \code{NumericVector}, \code{arma::mat}).
#' }
#'
#' Kernel wrappers contain all R‑level logic and none of the OpenCL plumbing.
#' They provide a stable, user‑facing API while delegating GPU execution to
#' the runner.
#'
#' In \pkg{glmbayes}, the function \code{f2_f3_opencl()} is the kernel wrapper
#' corresponding to \code{f2_f3_kernel_runner()}. It flattens inputs, selects
#' the correct kernel based on the GLM family and link, assembles the program
#' source, calls the runner, and returns the results as R objects.
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Why Separate Runners and Wrappers?}{
#' This two‑layer design is recommended because it:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item isolates OpenCL resource management from R‑level logic,
#'   \item makes kernel runners reusable across many models,
#'   \item simplifies debugging by separating data preparation from GPU
#'         execution,
#'   \item allows wrappers to evolve independently of the low‑level runner,
#'   \item enables consistent program assembly across kernels, and
#'   \item keeps exported R functions clean, readable, and easy to maintain.
#' }
#'
#' While users are free to design their own structure, adopting this pattern
#' generally leads to clearer code and more maintainable OpenCL integrations.
