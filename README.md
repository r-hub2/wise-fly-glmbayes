glmbayes provides independent and identically distributed (iid) samples for Bayesian Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).
Its primary interface, glmb(), serves as a Bayesian analogue to R's glm() function, supporting Gaussian, Poisson,
Binomial, and Gamma families under log-concave likelihoods. Sampling for most models is performed using accept-reject
methods based on likelihood subgradients (Nygren and Nygren, 2006). For Gaussian models, the package also includes
lmb(), a Bayesian counterpart to R's lm().

The package includes a rich set of supporting tools for prior specification, model diagnostics, and method functions
that mirror those for lm() and glm(). Most functions are extensively documented, and a comprehensive set of vignettes
are available to guide users through the package's capabilities.

The package is currently available on R-Universe, with plans for a future CRAN submission. For recent updates and planned enhancements, see

## Installation

To install the current development version (excluding OpenCL functionality):

install.packages("glmbayes",
                 repos = c("https://knygren.r-universe.dev",
                           "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

To install a version suitable for large models with GPU acceleration, follow the instructions from 

**Chapter 12 - Large Models: GPU Acceleration using OpenCL**
https://knygren.r-universe.dev/articles/glmbayes/Chapter-12.html

## Minimal Working Example

    library(glmbayes)

    # Dobson (1990), p. 93: Randomized Controlled Trial
    counts <- c(18,17,15,20,10,20,25,13,12)
    outcome <- gl(3,1,9)
    treatment <- gl(3,3)
    print(d.AD <- data.frame(treatment, outcome, counts))

    ## Classical glm
    glm.D93 <- glm(counts ~ outcome + treatment,
                   family = poisson())

    ## Bayesian glmb
    # Step 1: Set up prior
    ps <- Prior_Setup(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poisson())
    mu <- ps$mu
    V  <- ps$Sigma

    # Step 2: Fit using glmb
    glmb.D93 <- glmb(counts ~ outcome + treatment,
                     family = poisson(),
                     pfamily = dNormal(mu = mu, Sigma = V))

    summary(glmb.D93)

## Supported families, links, and pfamilies

As with the glm() function, models are specified by providing a symbolic description of the linear predictor
(using a formula) and a description of the error distribution (using a family and a link function). In addition, glmb()
also requires a prior specification, provided through a pfamily object. The available combinations of likelihood families,
link functions, and compatible pfamilies are:

| family                     | Available Link Functions           | Compatible pfamilies                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gaussian                   | identity                           | dNormal, dGamma, dNormal_Gamma, dIndependent_Normal_Gamma |
| Poisson / Quasi-Poisson    | log                                | dNormal                                                    |
| Binomial / Quasi-Binomial  | logit, probit, cloglog             | dNormal                                                    |
| Gamma                      | log                                | dNormal, dGamma                                            |

More specifically, each pfamily constructor requires parameters associated with the prior. The available pfamilies and their usage signatures are:

- dNormal(mu, Sigma, dispersion = NULL)
- dGamma(shape, rate, beta, disp_lower = NULL, disp_upper = NULL)
- dNormal_Gamma(mu, Sigma_0, shape, rate) — for Gaussian models, pass **`Prior_Setup()$Sigma_0`** as `Sigma_0`
- dIndependent_Normal_Gamma(
    mu,
    Sigma,
    shape,
    rate,
    max_disp_perc = 0.99,
    disp_lower = NULL,
    disp_upper = NULL
  )

To facilitate prior specification, the package provides a Prior_Setup() function, which extracts the needed prior parameters based on the same
symbolic model description and family specification used by glm(). By default, Prior_Setup() returns a reasonable prior specification
(described elsewhere), and optional arguments allow users to request alternative prior structures.

All supported models feature log-concave likelihoods, enabling efficient iid sampling via enveloping functions and
subgradient-based accept-reject algorithms (for models where other standard iid sampling algorithms are unavailable).

    example("rNormalGLM_std")

    ## Detailed simulation pipeline for rIndepNormalGammaReg models (Vignette Chapter A07)
    example("rIndepNormalGammaReg_std")

## Methodology

For generalized linear models where well known sampling methods are unavailable, sampling follows the
framework from Nygren and Nygren (2006), using likelihood subgradients to construct enveloping functions for
the posterior distribution. When the posterior is approximately normal, the expected number of draws per
acceptance is bounded as per that paper and as discussed in our vignettes.
Dispersion can be sampled via `rGamma_reg()` (standalone) or jointly with coefficients via
`rNormalGamma_reg()` and `rindepNormalGamma_reg()`.

## GPU Acceleration Using OpenCL

The implemented algorithms tend to have acceptable performance on CPUs up to around 10-14 dimensions.
For larger models, the envelope construction is embarrassingly parallel. To accelerate envelope construction
in such cases, the package provides optional GPU acceleration using OpenCL. This requires that users have
GPU enabled machines and an OpenCL installation. These features are discussed in more detail in two of
our vignettes.

Together, these vignettes form a comprehensive reference that supports users at all levels, 
from first-time Bayesian GLM users to researchers interested in the mathematical and computational
details behind the samplers.

## Feature Highlights

- S3 interface mirroring the structure of base glm()
- Accept-reject sampling for log-concave likelihoods
- Samplers for both fixed and variable dispersion
- Extensive vignettes to guide users through the package's capabilities
- Modular prior setup function

## Limitations

- Non-log-concave likelihoods are not currently supported

## Future Plans

- Full CRAN submission 
- Poisson speed (OpenCL and simulation): Precompute the log-factorial term `log(y!)`
  once per observation and reuse it in both OpenCL envelope construction and
  accept-reject simulation, since it depends only on the response, to reduce
  redundant `lgamma` evaluation and improve performance for large Poisson models.
- Grid selection (simulation): Precompute cumulative PLSD and use inverse CDF
  sampling (e.g. binary search) to select the grid component per candidate
  instead of scanning PLSD, improving the simulation loop when many candidates
  are evaluated.
- Improve References for Vignettes and Select Functions
